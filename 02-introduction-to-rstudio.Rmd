RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

It runs R and allows users to develop and edit programs and offers higher quality graphics and a more user-friendly interface.

***Note: RStudio is not a standalone program, you must have a separate installation of R***

# Using the text editor in RStudio

.large[
Always use a text editor to type code so that it can be saved for reproducibility purposes.

How to open a text editor window:

1. Go to File > New File > R script

2. Go to File > Save and save this somewhere convenient for you with your other class materials with the filename "mmed501-r-session1.R"

After we have run all three lines of code, we see the results of our mean computation in the Console pane. 

And we see the resulting histogram in the Plots pane.

But how would we get these results out of RStudio to turn in for homework or share with collaborators? 

This is where **R Markdown** comes in handy.
